# graphTraversal
This project aims at generating Sparse and Dense graphs and analysing the following Shortest Path or Maximum Bandwidth traversals:
* Dijkstra's Algorithm without the use of Heap datastructure
* Dijkstra's Algorithm using the Heap datastructure
* Kruskal's Algorithm

Please refer **Rajesh_Satpathy_Project_Report.pdf** for an in-depth explanation on the project.

Note: The traversals are done on Adjacency Lists and not Adjacency Matrices
